🌍 Global Inflation Analysis (1980–2024)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global inflation trends across 196 countries from 1980 to 2024. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and forecasting, it examines long-term inflation behavior, highlights countries with extreme volatility, and forecasts inflation rates for selected economies.

📈 Key Insights

Inflation is highly skewed due to hyperinflation in a few countries (e.g., Venezuela, Congo D.R.).

Advanced economies (Japan, Switzerland, Singapore, Gulf states) maintain low, stable inflation.

Global crises create visible inflationary effects, but the intensity varies across countries.

Forecasts suggest moderate inflation stabilization in both the Philippines and United States by 2030.
